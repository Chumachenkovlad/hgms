# High Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) Model

### __BMN__ - Model of movement of magnetically targeted objects near the magnetic field of Biogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles

### __CYLINDER__ - Model of movement of magnetically targeted objects near the magnetic field of steel matrix (crossed cylinders)


## HOWTO

1. Create venv by

> python3 -m venv ./env

> source .env/bin/activate

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. go to BMN or CYLINDER dir

> cd BMN
> cd CYLINDER

3. Edit params at main.py

4. Run main.py

> python3 main.py
